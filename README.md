Neural Network Model using TensorFlow
Project Description
This project demonstrates how to build, compile, and train a neural network using TensorFlow. The neural network is designed for multi-class classification, incorporating preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. It includes saving the trained model and making predictions on unseen data.

Features
Load and preprocess a dataset.
Build a neural network with at least:
One hidden layer containing 128 neurons.
Output layer matching the number of classes in the dataset.
Use appropriate loss functions, optimizers, and metrics for compilation.
Train the model and evaluate its performance.
Save the trained model and use it for predictions.
Dependencies
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Install the required libraries by running:
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn

1.How to Run:

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository_link>
cd <repository_folder>

2.Dataset:

Replace the path to the dataset in the code (e.g., data = pd.read_csv("/path/to/your/dataset.csv")).
Ensure the dataset is a CSV file with:
Features as columns except for the last column.
The last column as the target labels.

3.Run the Script:

Use the terminal or command line to run the script
python main.py

4.Training Output:

The script will display training progress, accuracy, and loss for each epoch.
The trained model will be saved as custom_model.h5.

5.Making Predictions:

After training, the script will:
Load the saved model.
Predict the class labels for test data.
Display predicted and actual classes along with evaluation metrics.

|-- custom_model.h5   # Saved trained model (generated after running the script)


Code Highlights
Data Preprocessing:

Encodes categorical labels into numeric values.
Standardizes feature values to improve model performance.
Model Architecture:

A neural network with:
Input layer matching the number of features.
One hidden layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
Output layer with softmax activation.
Training:

Uses the adam optimizer and categorical_crossentropy loss function.
Tracks accuracy during training.
Saving and Loading Model:

The trained model is saved using TensorFlow’s model.save() function.
Predictions can be made after loading the saved model.

Sample Outputs
Training Progress:
Epoch 1/50
200/200 [==============================] - 1s 3ms/step - loss: 0.5681 - accuracy: 0.7893 - val_loss: 0.3245 - val_accuracy: 0.8840

Predicted vs. True Classes:
Predicted Classes: [1 0 2 ... 0 1 2]
True Classes:      [1 0 2 ... 0 1 2]

Test Accuracy:
Test Accuracy: 0.92
